</h2>
<p>chezmoi will overwrite the file the next time you run <code>chezmoi apply</code>. Until you
run <code>chezmoi apply</code> your modified <code>~/.zshrc</code> will remain in place.</p>

</h2>
<p>By default, chezmoi ignores everything that you haven&rsquo;t explicitly <code>chezmoi add</code>&lsquo;ed. If you have files in your source directory that you don&rsquo;t want added to
your destination directory when you run <code>chezmoi apply</code> add their names to a
file called <code>.chezmoiignore</code> in the source state.</p>
<p>Patterns are supported, and you can change what&rsquo;s ignored from machine to
machine. The full usage and syntax is described in the <a href="/docs/reference/#chezmoiignore">reference
manual</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>Yes. Run <code>chezmoi add</code> will update the source state with the target. To see
diffs of what would change, without actually changing anything, use <code>chezmoi diff</code>.</p>
<h2 id="once-ive-made-a-change-to-the-source-directory-how-do-i-commit-it">

</h2>
<p>You have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chezmoi cd</code> opens a shell in the source directory, where you can run your
usual version control commands, like <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>.</li>
<li><code>chezmoi git</code> and <code>chezmoi hg</code> run <code>git</code> and <code>hg</code> respectively in the source
directory and pass extra arguments to the command. If you&rsquo;re passing any
flags, you&rsquo;ll need to use <code>--</code> to prevent chezmoi from consuming them, for
example <code>chezmoi git -- commit -m &quot;Update dotfiles&quot;</code>.</li>
<li><code>chezmoi source</code> runs your configured version control system in your source
directory. It works in the same way as the <code>chezmoi git</code> and <code>chezmoi hg</code>
commands, but uses <code>sourceVCS.command</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-only-run-a-script-when-a-file-has-changed">
  How do I only run a script when a file has changed?
  <a class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-only-run-a-script-when-a-file-has-changed">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A common example of this is that you&rsquo;re using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and
have <code>.Brewfile</code> listing all the packages that you want installed and only want
to run <code>brew bundle --global</code> when the contents of <code>.Brewfile</code> have changed.</p>
<p>chezmoi has two types of scripts: scripts that run every time, and scripts that
only run when their contents change. chezmoi does not have a mechanism to run a
script when an arbitrary file has changed, but there are some ways to achieve
the desired behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Have the script create <code>.Brewfile</code> instead of chezmoi, e.g. in your
<code>run_once_install-packages</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
cat &gt; $HOME/.Brewfile <span style="color:#e6db74">&lt;&lt;EOF
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">brew &#34;imagemagick&#34;
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">brew &#34;openssl&#34;
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">EOF</span>

brew bundle --global
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use <code>.Brewfile</code>, and instead install the packages explicitly in
<code>run_once_install-packages</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/sh
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
brew install imagemagick <span style="color:#f92672">||</span> true
brew install openssl <span style="color:#f92672">||</span> true
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>|| true</code> is necessary because <code>brew install</code> exits with failure if the
package is already installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a script that runs every time (not just once) and rely on <code>brew bundle --global</code> being idempotent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a script that runs every time, records a checksum of <code>.Brewfile</code> in
another file, and only runs <code>brew bundle --global</code> if the checksum has
changed, and updates the recorded checksum after.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ive-made-changes-to-both-the-destination-state-and-the-source-state-that-i-want-to-keep-how-can-i-keep-them-both">
  I&rsquo;ve made changes to both the destination state and the source state that I want to keep. How can I keep them both?
  <a class="anchor" href="#ive-made-changes-to-both-the-destination-state-and-the-source-state-that-i-want-to-keep-how-can-i-keep-them-both">#</a>
</h2>
<p><code>chezmoi merge</code> will open a merge tool to resolve differences between the source
state, target state, and destination state. Copy the changes you want to keep in
to the source state.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-chezmoi-convert-all-my-template-variables-to-lowercase">
  Why does chezmoi convert all my template variables to lowercase?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-does-chezmoi-convert-all-my-template-variables-to-lowercase">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This is due to a feature in
<a href="https://github.com/spf13/viper"><code>github.com/spf13/viper</code></a>, the library that
chezmoi uses to read its configuration file. For more information see <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/463">this
GitHub issue</a>.</p>
<h2 id="chezmoi-makes-sshconfig-group-writeable-how-do-i-stop-this">
  chezmoi makes <code>~/.ssh/config</code> group writeable. How do I stop this?
  <a class="anchor" href="#chezmoi-makes-sshconfig-group-writeable-how-do-i-stop-this">#</a>
</h2>
<p>By default, chezmoi uses your system&rsquo;s umask when creating files. On most
systems the default umask is <code>0022</code> but some systems use <code>0002</code>, which means
that files and directories are group writeable by default.</p>
<p>You can override this for chezmoi by setting the <code>umask</code> configuration variable
in your configuration file, for example:</p>
<pre><code>umask = 0022
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this will apply to all files and directories that chezmoi manages and
will ensure that none of them are group writeable. It is not currently possible
to control group write permissions for individual files or directories. Please

<h2 id="can-i-change-how-chezmois-source-state-is-represented-on-disk">
  Can I change how chezmoi&rsquo;s source state is represented on disk?
  <a class="anchor" href="#can-i-change-how-chezmois-source-state-is-represented-on-disk">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are a number of criticisms of how chezmoi&rsquo;s source state is represented on
disk:</p>
<ol>
<li>The source file naming system cannot handle all possible filenames.</li>
<li>Not all possible file permissions can be represented.</li>
<li>The long source file names are verbose.</li>
<li>Everything is in a single directory, which can end up containing many entries.</li>
</ol>
<p>chezmoi&rsquo;s source state representation is a deliberate, practical compromise.</p>
<p>Certain target filenames, for example <code>~/dot_example</code>, are incompatible with
chezmoi&rsquo;s
<a href="/docs/reference/#source-state-attributes">attributes</a>
used in the source state. In practice, dotfile filenames are unlikely to
conflict with chezmoi&rsquo;s attributes. If this does cause a genuine problem for
you, please <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose">open an issue on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>dot_</code> attribute makes it transparent which dotfiles are managed by chezmoi
and which files are ignored by chezmoi. chezmoi ignores all files and
directories that start with <code>.</code> so no special whitelists are needed for version
control systems and their control files (e.g. <code>.git</code> and <code>.gitignore</code>).</p>
<p>chezmoi needs per-file metadata to know how to interpret the source file&rsquo;s
contents, for example to know when the source file is a template or if the
file&rsquo;s contents are encrypted. By storing this metadata in the filename, the
metadata is unambiguously associated with a single file and adding, updating, or
removing a single file touches only a single file in the source state. Changes
to the metadata (e.g. <code>chezmoi chattr +template *target*</code>) are simple file
renames and isolated to the affected file.</p>
<p>If chezmoi were to, say, use a common configuration file listing which files
were templates and/or encrypted, then changes to any file would require updates
to the common configuration file. Automating updates to configuration files
requires a round trip (read config file, update config, write config) and it is
not always possible preserve comments and formatting.</p>
<p>chezmoi&rsquo;s attributes of <code>executable_</code> and <code>private_</code> only allow a the file
permissions <code>0o644</code>, <code>0o755</code>, <code>0o600</code>, and <code>0o700</code> to be represented.
Directories can only have permissions <code>0o755</code> or <code>0o700</code>. In practice, these
cover all permissions typically used for dotfiles. If this does cause a genuine
problem for you, please <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/issues/new/choose">open an issue on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>File permissions and modes like <code>executable_</code>, <code>private_</code>, and <code>symlink_</code> could
also be stored in the filesystem, rather than in the filename. However, this
requires the permissions to be preserved and handled by the underlying version
control system and filesystem. chezmoi provides first-class support for Windows,
where the <code>executable_</code> and <code>private_</code> attributes have no direct equivalents and
symbolic links are not always permitted. Some version control systems do not
preserve file permissions or handle symbolic links. By using regular files and
directories, chezmoi avoids variations in the operating system, version control
system, and filesystem making it both more robust and more portable.</p>
<p>chezmoi uses a 1:1 mapping between entries in the source state and entries in
the target state. This mapping is bi-directional and unambiguous.</p>
<p>However, this also means that dotfiles that in the same directory in the target
state must be in the same directory in the source state. In particular, every
entry managed by chezmoi in the root of your home directory has a corresponding
entry in the root of your source directory, which can mean that you end up with
a lot of entries in the root of your source directory.</p>
<p>If chezmoi were to permit, say, multiple separate source directories (so you
could, say, put <code>dot_bashrc</code> in a <code>bash/</code> subdirectory, and <code>dot_vimrc</code> in a
<code>vim/</code> subdirectory, but have <code>chezmoi apply</code> map these to <code>~/.bashrc</code> and
<code>~/.vimrc</code> in the root of your home directory) then the mapping between source
and target states is no longer bidirectional nor unambiguous, which
significantly increases complexity and requires more user interaction. For
example, if both <code>bash/dot_bashrc</code> and <code>vim/dot_bashrc</code> exist, what should be
the contents of <code>~/.bashrc</code>? If you run <code>chezmoi add ~/.zshrc</code>, should
<code>dot_zshrc</code> be stored in the source <code>bash/</code> directory, the source <code>vim/</code>
directory, or somewhere else? How does the user communicate their preferences?</p>
<p>chezmoi has many users and any changes to the source state representation must
be backwards-compatible.</p>
<p>In summary, chezmoi&rsquo;s source state representation is a compromise with both
advantages and disadvantages. Changes to the representation will be considered,
but must meet the following criteria, in order of importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be fully backwards-compatible for existing users.</li>
<li>Fix a genuine problem encountered in practice.</li>
<li>Be independent of the underlying operating system, version control system, and
filesystem.</li>
<li>Not add significant extra complexity to the user interface or underlying
implementation.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="gpg-encryption-fails-what-could-be-wrong">
  gpg encryption fails. What could be wrong?
  <a class="anchor" href="#gpg-encryption-fails-what-could-be-wrong">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>gpg.recipient</code> key should be ultimately trusted, otherwise encryption will
fail because gpg will prompt for input, which chezmoi does not handle. You can
check the trust level by running:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --export-ownertrust
</code></pre>
<p>The trust level for the recipient&rsquo;s key should be <code>6</code>. If it is not, you can
change the trust level by running:</p>
<pre><code>gpg --edit-key $recipient
</code></pre>
<p>Enter <code>trust</code> at the prompt and chose <code>5 = I trust ultimately</code>.</p>

  chezmoi reports &ldquo;user: lookup userid NNNNN: input/output error&rdquo;
  <a class="anchor" href="#chezmoi-reports-user-lookup-userid-nnnnn-inputoutput-error">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This is likely because the chezmoi binary you are using was statically compiled
with <a href="https://musl.libc.org/">musl</a> and the machine you are running on uses
LDAP or NIS.</p>
<p>The immediate fix is to use a package built for your distriubtion (e.g a <code>.deb</code>
or <code>.rpm</code>) which is linked against glibc and includes LDAP/NIS support instead
of the statically-compiled binary.</p>

  What inspired chezmoi?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-inspired-chezmoi">#</a>
</h2>
<p>chezmoi was inspired by <a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>, but created because
Puppet is a slow overkill for managing your personal configuration files. The
focus of chezmoi will always be personal home directory management. If your
needs grow beyond that, switch to a whole system configuration management tool.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-use-ansiblechefpuppetsalt-or-similar-to-manage-my-dotfiles-instead">
  Why not use Ansible/Chef/Puppet/Salt, or similar to manage my dotfiles instead?
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-not-use-ansiblechefpuppetsalt-or-similar-to-manage-my-dotfiles-instead">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Whole system management tools are more than capable of managing your dotfiles,
but are large systems that entail several disadvantages. Compared to whole
system management tools, chezmoi offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small, focused feature set designed for dotfiles. There&rsquo;s simply less to learn
with chezmoi compared to whole system management tools.</li>
<li>Easy installation and execution on every platform, without root access.
Installing chezmoi requires only copying a single binary file with no external
dependencies. Executing chezmoi just involves running the binary. In contrast,
installing and running a whole system management tools typically requires
installing a scripting language runtime, several packages, and running a
system service, all typically requiring root access.</li>
</ul>
<p>chezmoi&rsquo;s focus and simple installation means that it runs almost everywhere:
from tiny ARM-based Linux systems to Windows desktops, from inside lightweight
containers to FreeBSD-based virtual machines in the cloud.</p>

  Can I use chezmoi to manage files outside my home directory?
  <a class="anchor" href="#can-i-use-chezmoi-to-manage-files-outside-my-home-directory">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In practice, yes, you can, but this is strongly discouraged beyond using your
system&rsquo;s package manager to install the packages you need.</p>
<p>chezmoi is designed to operate on your home directory, and is explicitly not a
full system configuration management tool. That said, there are some ways to
have chezmoi manage a few files outside your home directory.</p>
<p>chezmoi&rsquo;s scripts can execute arbitrary commands, so you can use a <code>run_</code> script
that is run every time you run <code>chezmoi apply</code>, to, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the target file outside your home directory a symlink to a file managed
by chezmoi in your home directory.</li>
<li>Copy a file managed by chezmoi inside your home directory to the target file.</li>
<li>Execute a template with <code>chezmoi execute-template --output=filename template</code>
where <code>filename</code> is outside the target directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>chezmoi executes all scripts as the user executing chezmoi, so you may need to
add extra privilege elevation commands like <code>sudo</code> or <code>PowerShell start -verb runas -wait</code> to your script.</p>
<p>chezmoi, by default, operates on your home directory but this can be overridden
with the <code>--destination</code> command line flag or by specifying <code>destDir</code> in your
config file, and could even be the root directory (<code>/</code> or <code>C:\</code>). This allows
you, in theory, to use chezmoi to manage any file in your filesystem, but this
usage is extremely strongly discouraged.</p>
<p>If your needs extend beyond modifying a handful of files outside your target
system, then existing configuration management tools like
<a href="https://puppet.com/">Puppet</a>, <a href="https://chef.io/">Chef</a>,
<a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, and <a href="https://www.saltstack.com/">Salt</a> are
much better suited - and of course can be called from a chezmoi <code>run_</code> script.
Put your Puppet Manifests, Chef Recipes, Ansible Modules, and Salt Modules in a
directory ignored by <code>.chezmoiignore</code> so they do not pollute your home
directory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;chezmoi&rdquo; splits to &ldquo;chez moi&rdquo; and pronounced /ʃeɪ mwa/ (shay-moi) meaning &ldquo;at
my house&rdquo; in French. It&rsquo;s seven letters long, which is an appropriate length for
a command that is only run occasionally.</p>
