<p>Manage your dotfiles across multiple machines, securely.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-chezmoi-do-and-why-should-i-use-it">What does chezmoi do and why should I use it?</h2>
<p>chezmoi helps you manage your personal configuration files (dotfiles, like
<code>~/.bashrc</code>) across multiple machines.</p>
<p>chezmoi is helpful if you have spent time customizing the tools you use (e.g.
shells, editors, and version control systems) and want to keep machines running
different accounts (e.g. home and work) and/or different operating systems (e.g.
Linux and macOS) in sync, while still being able to easily cope with differences
from machine to machine.</p>
<p>chezmoi has strong support for security, allowing you to manage secrets (e.g.
passwords, access tokens, and private keys) securely and seamlessly using a
password manager of your choice or gpg encryption.</p>
<p>In all cases you only need to maintain a single source of truth: a single branch
in a version control system (e.g. git) for everything public and a single
password manager for all your secrets.</p>
<p>If you do not personalize your configuration or only ever use a single operating
system with a single account and none of your dotfiles contain secrets then you
don&rsquo;t need chezmoi. Otherwise, read on&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="what-are-chezmois-key-features">What are chezmoi&rsquo;s key features?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Flexible: You can share as much configuration across machines as you want,
while still being able to control machine-specific details. You only need to
maintain a single branch. Your dotfiles can be templates (using
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/text/template"><code>text/template</code></a> syntax). Predefined
variables allow you to change behaviour depending on operating system,
architecture, and hostname.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal and secure: Nothing leaves your machine, unless you want it to. You
can use the version control system of your choice to manage your
configuration, and you can write the configuration file in the format of your
choice. chezmoi can retrieve secrets from <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>,
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>, <a href="https://www.gopass.pw/">gopass</a>,
<a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>, <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>,
<a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">pass</a>, <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a>,
Keychain, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring">Keyring</a>, or any
command-line utility of your choice. You can encrypt individual files with
<a href="https://www.gnupg.org">gpg</a>. You can checkout your dotfiles repo on as many
machines as you want without revealing any secrets to anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transparent: chezmoi includes verbose and dry run modes so you can review
exactly what changes it will make to your home directory before making them.
chezmoi&rsquo;s source format uses only regular files and directories that map
one-to-one with the files, directories, and symlinks in your home directory
that you choose to manage. If you decide not to use chezmoi in the future, it
is easy to move your data elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robust: chezmoi updates all files and symbolic links atomically (using
<a href="https://github.com/google/renameio"><code>google/renameio</code></a>). You will never be
left with incomplete files that could lock you out, even if the update process
is interrupted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declarative: you declare the desired state of files, directories, and symbolic
links in your source of truth and chezmoi updates your home directory to match
that state. What you want is what you get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fast and easy to use: chezmoi runs in fractions of a second and makes most
day-to-day operations one line commands, including installation,
initialization, and keeping your machines up-to-date. chezmoi can pull and
apply changes from your dotfiles repo in a single command, and automatically
commit and push changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="i-already-have-a-system-to-manage-my-dotfiles-why-should-i-use-chezmoi">I already have a system to manage my dotfiles, why should I use chezmoi?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>A custom shell script to install your dotfiles.</li>
<li><a href="http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html">GNU Stow</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://yadm.io/"><code>yadm</code></a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles">bare git repo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you&rsquo;ve probably run into at least one of the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to synchronize your dotfiles across multiple operating systems or
distributions, then you need to manually perform extra steps to cope with
differences from machine to machine. You might need to run different commands
on different machines, maintain separate per-machine branches or files (with
the associated hassle of merging, rebasing, or copying each change), or hope
that your custom logic handles the differences correctly. chezmoi uses a
single source of truth (a single branch) and a single command that works on
every machine. Individual files can be templates to handle machine to machine
differences, if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your system stores secrets in plain text, then you must be very careful
about where you clone it. If you clone it on your work machine then anyone
with access to your work machine (e.g. your IT department) will have access to
your home secrets. If you clone it on your home machine then you risk leaking
work secrets. With chezmoi you can store secrets in your password manager or
encrypt them, and even use different password managers or encryption keys for
your work and home machines. You can share your repository between your
personal and work machines, and even make your dotfiles repo public, without
leaving personal secrets on your work machine or work secrets on your personal
machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your system was written by you for your personal use, then it probably has
the minimum functionality that you need. You might need special logic to
handle dotfiles that need to be private or run configuration scripts
occasionally. chezmoi includes a huge range of battle-tested functionality
out-of-the-box, including dry-run and diff modes, conflict resolution, Windows
support, and much, much more. chezmoi is <a href="https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi/stargazers">used by thousands of
people</a>, so it is likely that
when you hit the limits of your existing dotfile management system, chezmoi
already has a tried-and-tested solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All systems suffer from the bootstrap problem: you need to install your system
before you can install your dotfiles. chezmoi provides one-line installs,
statically-linked binaries, packages for Linux and BSD distributions, Homebrew
formulae, Scoop support on Windows, and a initial config file generation
mechanism to make overcoming the bootstrap problem as painless as possible.</p>
